# This repo is supposed to be private

I'm trying to sign up for Github Pro but the upgrade page keeps telling me there's a billing issue and that they'll contact me in 48 hours, except I haven't even been asked for my billing info yet.

Anyway, when this is resolved, this repo will be private, as it's just the hosting space for [my site.](https://shortcutjar.com)

Thanks for stopping by anyway! :)
