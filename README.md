# Describe Images: AI-Powered Image Descriptions

Welcome to the Describe Images repository! This project aims to provide two powerful Apple Shortcuts, "Describe Screenshot" and "Describe Photo," which use OpenAI's GPT-4o to generate detailed descriptions of screenshots and photos. These shortcuts are designed with accessibility in mind, particularly for VoiceOver users, but can be beneficial for anyone looking to quickly understand the content of images.

## Why GitHub?

I initially planned to host these shortcuts on RoutineHub, a popular platform for sharing Apple Shortcuts. However, I realized that RoutineHub requires users to create an account to download shortcuts, and I don't feel comfortable forcing my users to create an account for a service just to download my Shortcuts.

## Shortcut Descriptions

### Describe Screenshot

Describe Screenshot allows you to take a screenshot on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac and instantly get a detailed description of its contents. This shortcut is particularly useful for VoiceOver users who may not be able to see the content of UI elements in inaccessible apps or games.

### Describe Photo

Describe Photo works similarly to Describe Screenshot, but it allows you to either:

1. Take a photo within the shortcut
2. Share one or more photos with the shortcut with the share sheet (iOS, iPad OS and Vision OS) or quick actions (macOS.)
